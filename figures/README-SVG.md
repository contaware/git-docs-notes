# Edit and Export

The `.svg` files have been created with [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com)

1. Run [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com) and open the `.drawio` file. 

2. Make your changes.

3. Choose `File → Export as → SVG...` and set it like:

   - Zoom: **100%**
   - Border Width: **0**
   - Size: **Diagram**
   - Checkmark on: **Transparent Background**
   - Checkmark on: **Include a copy of my diagram**  
     (that permits editing the .svg file in draw.io in case that the .drawio file is missing)
   - Links: **Automatic**

4. Press the `Export` button.
